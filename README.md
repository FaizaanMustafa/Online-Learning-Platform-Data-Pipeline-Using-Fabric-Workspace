# Online-Learning-Platform-Data-Pipeline-Using-Fabric-Workspace
  Created a data pipeline for an online learning platform involves collecting, processing, storing, and analyzing data generated by users, courses, assessments, and platform interactions. 

 ## Introduction
This project focuses on building a scalable data engineering solution for an online learning platform using Microsoft Fabric Workspace. Leveraging Azure Data Factory for ETL, ADLS Gen2 for data storage, and Lakehouse architecture, we enable unified data access and insights through Power BI reports for informed decision-making.
